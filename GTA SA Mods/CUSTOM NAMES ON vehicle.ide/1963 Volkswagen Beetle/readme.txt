If you want to add my car to your site you're free to do it but remember to 
give credits for me. And it would be nice to have email also so I'd know where 
this is available. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't take requests. My time is limited and I only do the cars what I want. If you're
gonna modify, use my car in a bigger mod or gonna convert it to another game please
ask permission first! I'll try to answer as soon as possible and will give permission most likely.
