You may upload this to your site if you want but
only if you don't chance the contents of the zip 
file in any way!  And please do send me an e-mail
if you add this to your site!  I insist!  :)

If you want to 
 - modify and release the modified car
 - convert the car to another game
 - make the car a part of some mod
e-mail me and ask for permission first!  I might not
answer in the same day or even in the same week, though.
