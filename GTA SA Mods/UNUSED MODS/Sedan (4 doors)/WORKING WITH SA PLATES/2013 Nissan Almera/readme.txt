2013 Nissan Almera (Philippines)

Info
In October 2011, Nissan launched a new model as the economical saloon car for the Eco-Car project in Thailand, which
was named Nissan Almera. The car is a rebadged version of the Nissan Latio (N17), which is based on the company's global V platform. It is equipped
with the same 1.2-litre petrol engine (HR12DE) as the Nissan March and has either a five-speed manual or a CVT transmission. The name is also used for
the car in Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, Mauritius and Nigeria.

In 2013, Nissan launched the Latio as the Almera in the Philippines and Malaysia.

The third generation Nissan Almera is currently produced in some African and Asian markets like Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa in Africa and Malaysia,
Philippines, Thailand in Asia and other Asian countries. It is available with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

In Mexico, the previous-generation Versa was renamed to V-Drive, to avoid confusion with the new-generation Versa launched in October, and drops the Sense and Advance trim lines.

In indonesia, the nissan almera was also sold, but only for taxi companies.
