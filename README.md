# Introduction

This is a personal collection of mods I've collected throughout the GTA games. This is my personal repository to keep track of the mods that I found cool, so I can just get them in 1 place rather than having to search for it again on the internet. As of this writing, only Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto: IV games are included, and I don't really plan on playing III and Vice City in the meantime.

Huge credits to the wonderful modders who make these games wonderful and better.

Due to Rockstar Games' policy on modding, scripts won't run unless the game version is downgraded. Car mods, however, don't, as they're merely replacing files but having too many high-res cars will cause the environment to glitch out. It's recommended to use the [fastman92 Limit Adjuster](https://gtaforums.com/topic/733982-fastman92-limit-adjuster/), which will break the game's limits, and allowing scripts and plugins to run.

* GTA SA: V1.0
